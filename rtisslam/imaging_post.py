"""Post-processing of 2D energyscapes before RTISSLAM.

RW-CFAR (Range-Wise CFAR; Jan's name, 2026-10-12; in code the keys are still "ams*" for azimuthal mean
subtraction), from the RTIS pipeline: per range cell, the mean
energy over all directions is subtracted and the result is clipped at zero,
    P+(r, psi) = max(P(r, psi) - mean_psi' P(r, psi'), 0),
i.e. a cell-averaging CFAR threshold (gain alpha, 1 above; the RTIS pipeline typically uses ~1.5) whose reference cells are all directions at the same range. The
sidelobes of a strong reflector spread over all directions at its range and raise exactly that mean.
Energyscapes are in dB; zeros map to FLOOR_DB.
